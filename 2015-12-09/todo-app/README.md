# Todo App demo

This is demo from my live coding session, which took place on IX ngParty meetup.
I've showcased here how you can easily migrate your existing NG1 + ES5 code to
modular nad component driven NG1 + Typescript + ngMetadata app, which will be ready for Angular 2.

you can find here are 3 folders which consist of

- `/start` starting ES5 + NG1 todo app
- `/live-coding` starting app migrated to TS + NG1 + ngMetadata skeleton
- `/finish` finished app sliced to components

# how to run

Just hop to every folder and do following:

- `npm install`
- `npm start`
- open your browser on provided port ( which you'll se in console )
